# Full-Stack Project with Next.js

This is a full-stack project with **Next.js** on the front-end and a back-end built in Node.js. The front-end and back-end are hosted locally at the following URLs:

- **Front-end**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Back-end**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

>⚠️ **Note**: The time for this project was a bit short for me, so I managed to implement only basic styling on the front-end. In the `main` branch, the project was delivered by the proposed deadline. However, the `moretime` branch contains improved styles and layout enhancements.

## Configuration

There is no need to set up a `.env` file, as all routes and configurations are already defined.

### Pre-installation

Before installing the dependencies, make sure to run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Front-end**:
   - Navigate to the front-end folder.
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **Back-end**:
   - Navigate to the back-end folder.
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

Once both servers are running, the front-end will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the back-end at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Project Structure

- **Front-end**: Built with **Next.js**, using components to display data.
- **Back-end**: A simple API built with **Node.js** and **Express** that provides data for the front-end.
