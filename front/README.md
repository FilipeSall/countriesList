# Full-Stack Project with Next.js

This is a full-stack project with **Next.js** on the front-end and a back-end built in Node.js. The front-end and back-end are hosted locally at the following URLs:

- **Front-end**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Back-end**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Configuration

There is no need to set up a `.env` file, as all routes and configurations are already defined.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies**:
   - Navigate to both the front-end and back-end folders, and run the following command in each:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run the servers**:
   - **Front-end**:
     - Navigate to the front-end folder.
     - Start the development server:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

   - **Back-end**:
     - Navigate to the back-end folder.
     - Start the development server:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

Once both servers are running, the front-end will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the back-end at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Project Structure

- **Front-end**: Built with **Next.js**, using components to display data.
- **Back-end**: A simple API built with **Node.js** with **Express** that provides data for the front-end.
